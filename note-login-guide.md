# 🔐 Login & Authentication Guidance

Hey👋

I noticed there isn’t any authentication logic set up yet, so here’s a quick overview of your options and a neutral starting point.

## 🧭 Options for Adding Login Functionality

### 1️⃣ Supabase (Recommended for Fast Setup)
- Easy to integrate with any front-end (Next.js, React, or plain JS).
- Handles sign-up, login, password reset, and user management.
- Provides built-in Postgres + API for user data.
- Free tier for small projects.
---Also the one I am currently using for my app---

### 2️⃣ Firebase Authentication
- Simple setup for email/password or Google/Apple sign-in.
- Built-in analytics, hosting, and real-time database if you ever expand.

### 3️⃣ Custom Backend (Node + Express)
- Full control, but requires building everything yourself: routes, database, token storage, etc.
- More flexibility for future complex roles or permissions.

## 🧩 Recommended Next Step
For now, I’ve included a **basic login backbone layout** in this branch.
It doesn’t use any specific platform — just a clean structure that can plug into any of the options above when you’re ready.

It includes:
- A simple `LoginForm` component.
- Input fields for email and password.
- Placeholder login handler that you can later connect to your chosen service.

This gives us a clean UI and workflow without locking you into a backend yet.

🪄 Once you decide which system you prefer, I can help you wire it up safely.
Everything here is optional and built to support your existing structure.
