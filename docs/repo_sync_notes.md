# 🪶 Repo Sync Notes

This file helps track syncs between Guardian’s main repo and Rebecca’s fork.

---

## 🌿 How to Sync (Run in Your Codespace Terminal)

1. Add Guardian’s repo as an **upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<GuardianUsername>/<GuardianRepoName>.git
Fetch latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git fetch upstream
Merge them into your fork’s main branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
Your fork is now up to date.

🧭 Notes
Sync once in a while, especially before starting a new suggestion branch.

Always make sure you’re on your own main before merging.

## 📘 `guardian_repo_structure.md` (optional but super helpful)

```markdown
# 📘 Guardian Repo Structure Overview

This file is meant to outline how the repository is organized as of the last sync.

---

## 🧩 Example Layout
/components/ → UI pieces or reusable blocks
/pages/ → Page-level files (if using Next.js)
/api/ → Serverless functions or endpoints
/lib/ → Helper functions or data utilities
/public/ → Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
/docs/ → Documentation, notes, and collaboration files

### 🪄 Tip
Keep this file updated as new sections or features are added.  
It helps both Guardian and Rebecca navigate faster when reviewing or improving parts of the system.


commiting new codes
🪶 Step-by-Step

1️⃣ Check what’s untracked or modified

git status


You should see something like:

Untracked files:
  docs/suggestion_index.md
  docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
  docs/repo_sync_notes.md
  docs/guardian_repo_structure.md


2️⃣ Stage the files

git add docs/


(This grabs all the new .md files inside the docs folder.)

3️⃣ Commit your work

git commit -m "Docs: add collaboration and organization markdown files"


4️⃣ Push to your suggestion branch
Since you’re on suggestion/fix-login-flow, push to that same branch:

git push origin suggestion/fix-login-flow


5️⃣ Confirm in GitHub

Go to your fork on GitHub → Branches → select suggestion/fix-login-flow.

You’ll see your new markdown files appear in /docs/.

If everything looks good, click Compare & pull request to open it for Guardian.

✨ Tip for later
If you ever want to commit multiple new docs again, you can run:

git add docs/*.md
git commit -m "Docs: update collaboration notes"
git push


That will catch all Markdown files in one go.
