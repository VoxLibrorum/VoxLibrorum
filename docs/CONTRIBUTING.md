# 🤝 Contribution Guidelines for Guardian’s Repository

Welcome!  
This project includes collaborative input from Rebecca (blackroses27).  
All contributions are **optional suggestions** — Guardian retains full control over what gets merged.

---

## 🌱 Workflow

1. **Branch Naming**
   - Use the format:  
     `suggestion/<short-description>`  
     Example:  
     `suggestion/improve-readme`,  
     `suggestion/add-theme-support`.

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Start with:  
     `Suggestion:`  
     Example:  
     `Suggestion: simplify login flow structure`

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Each suggestion is submitted as a **Pull Request** for Guardian to review.
   - Rebecca will include:
     - A short explanation of what changed.
     - Why it helps.
     - Notes if code is placeholder / non-breaking.
   - Guardian can:
     - Merge ✅ if it fits the project goals.
     - Close ❌ if it’s not needed (no harm done).
     - Comment 💬 to discuss details.

## 🧩 Branch Lifecycle

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Create branch (e.g. `git checkout -b suggestion/improve-ui`) |
| 2 | Make and test changes in Codespaces |
| 3 | Commit with descriptive message |
| 4 | Push: `git push origin suggestion/improve-ui` |
| 5 | Open Pull Request on GitHub |

## 🔒 Safety & Boundaries

- All work is done in Rebecca’s fork.  
- The main repo remains fully under Guardian’s control.  
- No auto-merges or code overwrites.  
- Rebecca uses Codespaces to keep her planner (WXP) entirely separate.

---

## 💬 Communication

Pull requests and notes may include:
- Explanations of code changes.  
- Options or guidance (never forced decisions).  
- Comments left directly in the GitHub PR view.
