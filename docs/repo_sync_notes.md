# ðŸª¶ Repo Sync Notes

This file helps track syncs between Guardianâ€™s main repo and Rebeccaâ€™s fork.

---

## ðŸŒ¿ How to Sync (Run in Your Codespace Terminal)

1. Add Guardianâ€™s repo as an **upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<GuardianUsername>/<GuardianRepoName>.git
Fetch latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git fetch upstream
Merge them into your forkâ€™s main branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
Your fork is now up to date.

ðŸ§­ Notes
Sync once in a while, especially before starting a new suggestion branch.

Always make sure youâ€™re on your own main before merging.
